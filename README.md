cub3D is a project that will require to make a semi-3D game using the raycasting engine, which is the same engine that Wolfenstein 3D the first ever FPS game used.
This project was done as a team project between me and Martin Ruiz Lumibao @Doyisnotavailabl.
Some features added to it:
1- cross-platform compilation on Linux and Macos.
2- Wall collision.
3- Mouse pov control (bonus).
